# HAC - Hardware Acceleration Club

Welcome to the Hardware Acceleration Club (HAC) repository! 

## Introduction

HAC is an ongoing project aimed at building an accelerator in a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) for the Full Wave Inversion (FWI) Algorithm. Our goal is to merge High-Level Synthesis (HLS) and Register Transfer Level (RTL) techniques to maximize efficiency and minimize development effort.

## About

This repository serves as the central hub for documentation, code, tools, and discoveries related to the HAC project. It is maintained and updated by the project members:

- **João Pedro L. F. Belga**
- **Pedro S. Lins**

## Project Status

This is a documentation project in construction. As the project progresses, we will continuously update this repository with:

- Discoveries
- Developments
- Tools
- Useful code snippets

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from anyone interested in hardware acceleration, FPGA development, or the FWI algorithm. If you have ideas, improvements, or discoveries to share, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.
